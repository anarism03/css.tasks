## Assignment 2

Create a CSS animation that makes a button appear to "pop" out of the screen when clicked.

1. Create an HTML file with a button element that has a class of "pop-button".
In a separate CSS file, style the button element with a background color, a border radius of 10px, and a box-shadow property with a spread radius of 10px and a blur radius of 5px.
2. Add a CSS transition to the box-shadow property that will animate it over a duration of 0.2 seconds.
3. Add a CSS transform to the button element that will scale it up to 1.1 times its original size on hover.
4. Add a CSS animation to the button element that will create a "pop" effect when it is clicked. This can be achieved by animating the box-shadow property to have a larger spread radius and a larger blur radius over a duration of 0.1 seconds, and then animating it back to its original values over the next 0.1 seconds.
5. Test the animation by opening the HTML file in a web browser and clicking the button to see it "pop" out of the screen.
>Bonus task: Add a sound effect to the button animation using JavaScript. The sound effect should play when the button is clicked and the "pop" animation is triggered.
