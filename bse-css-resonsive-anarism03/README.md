Add a CSS media query and appropriate styles so that the webpage looks like the screenshots below when resized to smaller widths (for small phones/windows
). Specifically:
* The sidebar should be hidden.
* The body should have no padding.
* The image should be half the width of the page.
* The navigation items should each be on their own line.
* The header should be fixed, so that it stays at the top after scrolling.
* Content should cover 90 percent of the page
* The content in the footer should be centered
