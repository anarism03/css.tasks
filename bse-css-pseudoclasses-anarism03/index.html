            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language
            used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It is the
            basic building block of web development and is used to structure
            content on the internet. HTML provides a set of elements or tags
            that define the structure of a web page, such as headings,
            paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. HTML documents are text
            files that contain these HTML elements, and web browsers interpret
            these documents to display the content to users.

            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for
            describing the presentation and formatting of a document written in
            HTML or XML. In simpler terms, CSS is used to control the visual
            presentation of web pages, including elements like layout, colors,
            fonts, spacing, and more. CSS allows developers to separate the
            structure of a web page (defined by HTML) from its presentation and
            styling. By doing so, developers can make changes to the appearance
            of a website without altering its underlying structure. This
            separation of concerns enhances maintainability and flexibility in
            web development.

            JavaScript is a high-level, versatile, and interpreted programming
            language primarily used for client-side web development. It allows
            developers to add dynamic and interactive features to web pages,
            making them more engaging and user-friendly. JavaScript is an
            essential component of modern web development, working in
            conjunction with HTML and CSS.JavaScript is primarily executed in
            the user's web browser, enabling it to interact with the Document
            Object Model (DOM) of a web page. This allows developers to
            manipulate and modify the content, structure, and style of a webpage
            dynamically.
